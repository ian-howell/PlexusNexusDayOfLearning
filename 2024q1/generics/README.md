# Generics

Generics refers to a powerful concept that allows us to write code that is independent of the type of data it
works with. This allows us to write reusable code that can be used with different types of data.

## Examples

The following are the examples I will be working through while learning about generics.

### Map, Filter, Reduce

Map, filter, and reduce are three common higher order functions that are used to manipulate arrays. I will be
writing generic versions of these functions that can be used with any type of array.

### Stacks and Queues

I will be writing a generic stack and queue class that can be used with any type of data.

### Graph Traversal

This repository will contain a generic version of Breadth First Search and Depth First Search that can be used
with any type of graph. Time permitting, I will also write a generic version of Dijkstra's algorithm and A*
search.

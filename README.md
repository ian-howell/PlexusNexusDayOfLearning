# PlexusNexus Day Of Learning

This repository is a catch-all for anything I deem relevant to my PlexusNexus Days of Learning. This includes
notes, code, and anything else I find useful. The repository's is structured by quarter, and then by topic (if
there's more than one). The README.md file in each directory will contain a brief overview of the topic, as
well as any notes I've taken.
